In short, this component is published as either es5 or es6.  The JS is accompanied by a [CSS modules](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-styling-components/table-of-contents) stylesheet.  To consume both in your app, you'll need a JS and CSS module loader (eg, [webpack](https://github.com/jaketrent/react-chart-loading/blob/master/examples%2Fwebpack.config.js)).
